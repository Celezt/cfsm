# CFSM

`cfsm`, also called Celezt's Finite State Machine is a
library that implements FSM to rust.
It uses unction pointers as state and struct as machine.

Decision Tree

Generic implementation that takes in a unique id `&str` that is implemented as
a hash map. It decides what route to take base on the decision that has `PartialEq` +
`PartialOrd` + `Copy` derived. By using the `Traverse` struct, it is possible to move
along the tree based on what values it compares to.

# Examples

```
use cdt::{DT, Traverse, PartialOp};

// Initialize a new decision tree by creating a root that
// has by default the id "root"
let mut tree = DT::init();

/// Append new children to the root
/// .append(unique id, data, decision)
tree.append("first", "banana", true)
    .append("second", "apple", false)
    .append("third", "orange", false);

/// Get node by its id
tree.find("second").unwrap()
    .append("fourth", "red apple", true)
    .append("fifth", "green apple", false);

let mut travel = Traverse::start(tree);

// apple because it is the first one that are false
// The decision goes from left to right (top to bottom)
assert!(travel.traverse(false, PartialOp::Equal)
        .unwrap().decision().unwrap() == false);

// The first one of the children to apple that are true
assert!(travel.traverse(true, PartialOp::Equal)
        .unwrap().decision().unwrap() == true);
